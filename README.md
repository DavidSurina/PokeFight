## Project Overview

### PART I: NodeJS API with ExpressJS

- Create a ExpressJS application
- Use data of JSON: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json/master/pokedex.json
- Create 3 routes
  - /pokemons - complete list of pokemons
  - /pokemon/:id - one pokemon with the id
  - /pokemon/:id/:info(name|type|base) - only the information about names, types or base of the pokemon with the id
  - Use the MVC pattern
  - Enable all the CORS
  - Host your API on Heroku

### PART II: React Application

- Create a React application
- Set the proxy with your live API address while in development
- Create 3 routes that will gather information from your API 
  - /  -> Returns all the pokemon names in a list and includes a link to the detailed view  
  - /pokemon/:id -> Detailed view with the name, type and base 
  - /pokemon/:id/:info -> Super detailed view with only the names or the types and or the bases
  - Host your React application on Netlify 	

### PART III: Pokefight

- Turn this app into a game
- Use a UI library of your choice
- Allow the user to choose the Pokemon he will fight with from the list of available Pokemons
- In the UI show which Pokemons are going to fight, and their respective infos.
- Define a game mechanism, how to win, and implement that logic into your React app.

### PART IV: Show the high scores

- Create a mongoDB database to save information about each game played
- Establish a Mongoose client to connect to your database
- Create a Game schema and model in the appropriate models folder.
- Create a route in your back-end where you will send the result of each game.
  -  /game/save
- Save this game data in your DB.
- Create a route where the front-end can retrieve all the previous games infos
  - /game/leaderboard
- Your React app should then have a /leaderboard route where the information of the previous games will be displayed.
